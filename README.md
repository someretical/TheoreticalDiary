## About

This app is still under development...

Check back later?

## Building

### Windows

The prebuilt binaries are available in `theoretical-diary-x64` (check the result of the latest successful Github actions for `windows.yml`)

If you want to build by yourself, GLHF. I'm not bothered to go through all the instructions since it's so complicated setting everything up. You can take a look at `windows.yml` to see how I did it.

### Linux

The prebuilt app image is available as `theoretical-diary-linux` (check the result of the latest successful Github actions for `linux.yml`). You will still need to install the runtime packages, just not the `-dev` ones.

If you want to build yourself, check out `linux.yml` for how to build your own app image.
